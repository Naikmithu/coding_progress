# coding_progress

This Repo will be a progress tracker for my DSA preparation (Language : Python)

It will not be in order , i am learning some concepts while coding 

Date : 11-02-2025,11:20

Concept :
hash_map :
          In python hash_map uses dictionary , when key value pair is added to hash_map 
          Python will convert the key to hashcode and this will be stored in memory
          If multiple keys map to the same index (collision), Python resolves it using open addressing (probing) or chaining.

Came across a difference when running java code and python code in leetcode ...checked the runtime difference ,Java was faster 
Why ?
Compiled and Interpreted Language :
Java : Compliled + interpreted 
Python : Interpreted 

Difference 
-> Why faster ..code first gets converted to Machine code before execution
-> why slower ..code Interpreter translates and runs line by line 

But there is CPython has capabilies of Compilation+Interpretation

# also working on shell_command python project 

Lokking at all the libraries its mindblowing

Solved 1 easy question (How many numbers are smaller than the current number):
-> here also used hash_map or say (dictionary)


# Completed 6 tasks in shell_command project

# Completed 2 more tasks in shell_command ...
Will give a brief of what all i studied in Shell_command project till now 

Important libraries :
-> os ,subprocess,shuttil
-> shuttil here i used to fetch the path of shell builtin commands from my system (shuttil.which())
-> shuttil is direct but in os we need to specify the path like (os.getenv(PATH))
-> subprocess here its used to run the builtin commands (same like shell does)

-> Spiral matrix done easy one but should be aware of all loop
